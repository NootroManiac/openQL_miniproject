## Features

- Email Phishing Detection
  - Pattern matching for common phishing indicators
  - Sentiment analysis for detecting AI-generated content
  - Text classification for phishing detection

- Voice Impersonation Detection
  - Audio analysis using Wav2Vec2 model
  - Feature extraction and classification
  - Support for various audio formats

- Video Deepfake Detection
  - Frame-by-frame analysis
  - Deep learning-based classification
  - Support for various video formats

  Fuzzing is supported with the email phishing dectection function
  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-threat-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#you may want to install requirements after making a virtual environment by following the instructions on the fuzzer installation instructions below
```


## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
3. Run the test_detectors.py file in a different terminal and modify the requests. Alternatively, go and send your own JSON requests.
3. Add .wav and .mov files to the test files folder and rename your files to the correct keywords. Alternatively, go and send your own JSON requests. (it works without files as well)
3. API Endpoints:

   - Email Detection:
     ```
     POST /detect/email
     Content-Type: application/json
     
     {
         "subject": "email subject",
         "body": "email body",
         "sender": "sender@example.com",
         "attachments": []
     }
     ```

   - Voice Detection:
     ```
     POST /detect/voice
     Content-Type: multipart/form-data
     
     audio_file: <audio file>
     ```

   - Video Detection:
     ```
     POST /detect/video
     Content-Type: multipart/form-data
     
     video_file: <video file>
     ```


## API Documentation

Once the server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

## Response Format

All endpoints return a JSON response in the following format:

```json
{
    "is_threat": boolean,
    "confidence": float,
    "threat_type": string,
    "details": {
        // Additional details specific to each detection type
    }
}
```
Additionally, the responses are saved into a JSON file and printed into the terminal.
## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for better performance)
- See requirements.txt for Python package dependencies
